# IoT-Based-Waste-Management-System
This project leverages IoT to optimize urban waste management by using ultrasonic sensors to detect bin fill levels and transmit data via Wi-Fi to a central server. I designed the sensor network and built a cloud-based dashboard for real-time monitoring and reporting, enhancing my skills in IoT protocols and cloud computing.
